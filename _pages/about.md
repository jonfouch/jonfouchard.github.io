I'm a CNRS research fellow, biophysicist working in the department of Developemental Biology of the [IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) institute at Sorbonne Universit√©. 

During developement and at adult age, cells and tissue live in dynamic mechanical environment. They are subjected to stretches, compressions, changes in rigidity of their substrate, which occur over a variety of time-scales. I'm interested in how cells and tissues change shape or mechanical properties in order to adapt to such dynamic boundary conditions. 
Understanding this necessitates concepts from soft matter and active matter physics, and some mechanics. Most of my effort is dedicated to providing mechanical measurements at the cell and/or tissue scales coupled to live imaging and molecular perturbations of the biological structures of interest. 

I'm currently a member of the group [Muscle and tendon formation and repair](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/developmental-biology-laboratory/muscle-and-tendon-formation-and-repair) where I work on the dynamics of soft fibrous tissues with a particular interest in how active forces control their mechanical properties during development and pathology. I'm still interested in some of my past research topics like single cell mechanics and epithelial tissue mechanics. I'm also curious about the evolution of scientific language, currently working on the names and representations associated to living tissues.
