I'm a CNRS research fellow, biophysicist working in the department of Developemental Biology of the [IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) Institute at Sorbonne Universit√©. 

During development and at adult age, cells and tissues are subjected to stretches, compressions or changes of the rigidity of their substrate. In order to adapt to such dynamic mechanical environment, they often change shape or mechanical properties. I'm interested in the mechanisms permitting such adaptation, with a particular focus on the collective response of cytoskeletal elements, independent of signalling.
Most of my effort is dedicated to providing mechanical measurements at the cell and/or tissue scales coupled to live imaging and molecular perturbations of the biological structures of interest. 

I'm currently a member of the group [Muscle and tendon formation and repair](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/developmental-biology-laboratory/muscle-and-tendon-formation-and-repair) where I work on the dynamics of soft fibrous tissues and the role of active forces in the definition of their mechanical properties during limb development and tumorigenesis. I'm still interested in some of my past research topics like single cell mechanics and epithelial tissue mechanics. I'm also curious about the evolution of scientific language, currently working on the names and representations associated to living tissues.
