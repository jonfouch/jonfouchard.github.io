I'm a CNRS research fellow working in the department of Developemental Biology of the [IBPS institute](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) at Sorbonne Universit√©. 

My work is at the interface between biology, physics and mechanics. I couple custom-made mechanical setups to live imaging in order to understand how living systems adapt to mechanical stimuli or generate forces to realize biological functions.

My most recent interest is in the dynamics of soft fibrous tissues and how mechanical properties of these tissues are controlled during development and pathology. I'm still interested in some of my past research topics like single cell mechanics and mechano-sensing, cell division and epithelial tissue mechanics, in particular how they fold and flow.
