I'm a CNRS research fellow, biophysicist working in the department of Developmental Biology of the [IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) Institute at Sorbonne Universit√©, member of the group [Muscle and tendon formation and repair](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/developmental-biology-laboratory/muscle-and-tendon-formation-and-repair). 

My research deals with the mechanisms that permits cells and tissues to adapt to their changes in their mechanical environment. Indeed, during development and at adult age, cells and tissues are subjected to stretches, compressions or changes of the rigidity of their substrate. In order to adapt to such dynamic mechanical environment, they often change shape or mechanical properties. In my research, I focus on the mechanisms of adaptation that involve the collective response of contractile elements, independently of biochemical signalling.
For that, I develop mechanical setup providing measurements at the cell and/or tissue scales coupled to live imaging and molecular perturbations of the biological structures of interest. 

Currently, I work mainly on the dynamics of soft fibrous tissues and the role of active forces in the definition of their mechanical properties, a topic which has implications for development, physiology of adult organs and tumorigenesis. But I'm still interested in some of my past research topics, like single cell mechanosensing and epithelial tissue mechanics. I'm also curious about the evolution of scientific language, currently working on the [names and representations associated to living tissues](https://nomduntissu.hypotheses.org/).
