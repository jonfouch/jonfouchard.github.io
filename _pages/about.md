I'm a CNRS research fellow, biophysicist working in the department of Developemental Biology of the [IBPS](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en) institute at Sorbonne Universit√©. 

During developement and at adult age, cells and tissue live in dynamic mechanical environment. They adpat to those stresses of variable amplitudes applied at different time-scales, either by changing shape or mechanical properties. I'm interested in how cells and tissues adapt to such dynamic boundary conditions. This has applications to a large range of biological functions, such as developemental morphogenesis or cell mechano-sensing. 
Understanding this necessitates concepts from soft matter and active matter physics, and some mechanics. Most of my effort is dedicated to providing mechanical measurements at the cell and/or tissue scales coupled to live imaging and molecular perturbation of the biological structures of interest. 

I'm currently a member of the group [Muscle and tendon formation and repair](https://www.ibps.sorbonne-universite.fr/en/research/developmental-biology-laboratory/muscle-and-tendon-formation-and-repair) where I work on the dynamics of soft fibrous tissues with a particular interest in how active forces control their mechanical properties during development and pathology. I'm still interested in some of my past research topics like single cell mechanics and epithelial tissue mechanics. I'm also curious about the evolution of scientific language, currently working on the names and representations associated to living tissues.
