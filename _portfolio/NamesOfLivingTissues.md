This interdisciplinary project bridges history of scientific language, history of science and current research in biology with two objectives. First, the analysis of the variety of the names and representations of living tissues since Antiquity permits to look at contemporary problems in bio-medical sciences under a new eye. But, more importantly, this topic is a good model to observe how the way scientific discoveries are named feeds back onto the formation of scientific knowledge. 

**Research topics**

- Spreading of the word *Stroma* in bio-medical sciences during XIXth century. With Eva Gonzalez, Aydan Gün, Ana Isabel Duron Tejedor and François Ferrié.

- Apparition of the name *Collagen*. With Nawel Benhamed.
