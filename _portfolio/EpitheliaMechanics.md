This work has been done in the lab of [Guillaume Charras](https://charraslab.com/) at University College London, and in close collaboration with [Alex Kabla](https://kalab.emma.cam.ac.uk/). 
Here I have worked with fanstastic people : Tom Wyatt, Ana Lisica, Pierre Recho, Nargess Khalilgharibi, Alessandra Bonfanti, Julia Duque.
With Tom Wyatt, we clarified how epithelial monolayers relax folds in response to rapid compression at short time-scales.
