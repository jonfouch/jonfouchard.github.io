This is my main post-doc work, realized in the lab of [Guillaume Charras](https://charraslab.com/) at University College London, and in close collaboration with [Alex Kabla](https://kalab.emma.cam.ac.uk/).

I am very grateful to have worked with fanstastic PhD students and post-docs there : Tom Wyatt, Ana Lisica, Pierre Recho, Nargess Khalilgharibi, Alessandra Bonfanti, Julia Duque, Anna Bove and many others.

Epithelial monolayers...

**Research topics**
- Curling of epithelial monolayers. Role of assymetric active forces in bending of the epithelium free edge and regulation by exogenous in-plane deformations. Implications for developement. With Pierre Recho and others
- Buckling and rapid relaxation of folds of mono- and multi-layered epithelia in response to compression. With Tom Wyatt and others
- Creep and fracture of epithelial monolayers. This work was mainly driven by Julia Duque and Alessandra Bonfanti
