I am very grateful to have worked with fanstastic PhD students and post-docs there : Tom Wyatt, Ana Lisica, Pierre Recho, Nargess Khalilgharibi, Alessandra Bonfanti, Julia Duque, and also Anna Bove, Pierre Bohec, Manasi Kelkar, Kazunori Yamamoto.

Epithelia are two-dimensional cell sheets that line most of the body surfaces, separating internal and external environments. In order to maintain tissue integrity, they need to withstand mechanical stresses (stretches, bends or compressions). 
But they can also generate patterned mechanical stresses from within (through active forces), creating deformations which drive tissue morphogenesis during early development. 
I adressed these problems using suspended epithelia, a model of cultured epithelia, suspended between two rods and devoid of ECM.
